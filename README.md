# Trijam-TubeRush
An endless runner developed during the 3 hour game jam Trijam

Most interesting about this project was to find a way to create a function and interesting game loop in as little time as possible.

The curvature of the tube for example is generated by a shader based on camera space and instantly adds more interesting design to the demo within little developing time.
